# A Complete Data Analytics Project - The Bike Company Case Study.
## Introduction:
In the fast-paced world of transportation, bicycles have emerged as a popular and sustainable mode of travel, offering individuals an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to traditional means of commuting. As the demand for bicycles continue to rise, companies in the bike industry are faced with the challenge of understanding consumer preferences, optimizing their operations, and staying ahead in a competitive market. This particular project focuses on examining the vast amount of data available to a bike company, with the goal of extracting valuable insights that can drive informed decision-making and enhance overall business performance. My aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that will assist the company in making strategic choices related to product development, marketing campaigns and customer satisfaction. 

### Background:
This project is for the executive team of a retail bike company based in the United States with outlets in California, New York and Texas. It has a database on it product brands, product categories, customers, orders, performance of staff and their various store outlets. The primary objective of the executive team is to extract valuable insights regarding the sales trends of the company spanning a two-year period. Specifically, they seek to understand the revenue generated per region, store, product category, and brand, as well as identify the top customers and the best-performing staff members. As a data analyst, retrieve and analyze the necessary data from the company's database and provide insights that can help the executive team to gain comprehensive understanding of the company's performance, identify areas of improvement, and devise actionable strategies to propel growth and success.
